This is a project I created during my full stack program, Microsoft Edge seems to be the browser that works the best.

Due to GitHub Pages there are some features and links that are not working.

Site is made utilizing localStorage for the entire project, so it will initally lokk like there is nothing on the page. I have added code in the "Local Storage.txt" file, you just need to copy and paste it into your console.
